# Obsidian Test Document 5: Invalid Extension Edition

This is a test file which lacks an appropriate `.md` suffix, plus it has
several significant formatting issues, and as a result it should
_not_ be picked up or acted upon by most utilities in the suite.

(A copy of this file with the proper `.md` extension would have the correct
extension but would be a negative test for well-formedness.)

## File Linking Test
This file __does__ have a link to [[baz.txt]], which is an attachment that
should generally *NOT* be copied over (it's meant to never be linked to
from a valid document).
Since this isn't a valid Obsidian note, it should still be a negative test.
