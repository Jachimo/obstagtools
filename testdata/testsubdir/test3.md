# Obsidian Test Document Number 3

Test document 3 does not contain any linked documents (wiki-links)
or have any linked attachments.

This is yet another example of a sample Obsidian-flavor YAML/Markdown
text document.
This is the "content" portion of the document, which has Markdown
formatting included.
Above this is the "frontmatter" (or header), which is formatted in
YAML and includes the document's metadata.

## On the Dangers of Gardens

> You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don’t go into
> Mr. McGregor’s garden. Your Father had an accident there; he was put
> in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.
