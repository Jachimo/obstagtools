# Sample Obsidian Structured Text Document
This is a sample of a structured text document using an Obsidian-style
(also Jekyll-style) YAML "frontmatter" section, followed by
Markdown-styled content.

- Top Level List
  - Second Level List
  - Second Level List (continued)
  - Second Level List (even more)
- Top Level List Part Deux
- Top Level List: The Return of the List
