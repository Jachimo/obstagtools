# Sample Obsidian Structured Text Document
This is a sample of a structured text document using an
Obsidian-style (also Jekyll-style) YAML "frontmatter" section, followed by Markdown-styled content.

## Some Examples
Here we're just exercising the Markdown functionality...

- Top Level List
  - Second Level List
  - Second Level List (continued)
  - Second Level List (even more)
- Top Level List Part Deux
- Top Level List: The Return of the List

Are you sure that `2 + 2 = 4`?
